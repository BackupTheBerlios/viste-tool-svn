Each .cpp and .h file should include a comment header with the name of the file,
and a history of updates. Dates are written as YYYY-mm-dd. After the date, list
the name of the person(s) that update the file. For example:

/**
 * ReallyCoolHeaderFile.h
 *
 * 2012-01-01	Tim Peeters
 * - Creation of this file.
 *
 * 2012-02-12	Tim Peeters
 * - Add the doSomething() function.
 * - Remove the doNothing() function.
 */
 
If you make changes to a file, update the header with your changes.

We use Doxygen for documentation. Doxygen supports several documentation styles.
We follow the JavaDoc style, i.e.: documentation is enclosed by /** and */.
For example:

/**
 * This class is an example.
 * This is a more detailed description extending the brief description.
 */
class ExampleClass : public ParentClass

We use JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF for have brief and detailed descriptions.
Everything up to the first dot followed by a space or newline is the brief
description, and then follows the detailed description.

Function parameters are documented by @param. For example:

/**
 * This is an example function.
 * And here we have a detailed description for the function.
 *
 * @param
