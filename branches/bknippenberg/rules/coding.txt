Use java coding standards.

Check the indenting how I use it. And don't mess up my indents!
(If you use auto-indent in some code editors, then configure them correctly!)
Use FOUR (4) spaces for an indent. Tabs must be set every 8 spaces (not 4).

We make use of various namespaces.
Everything should have the namespace bmia.

Other namespaces depend on the module that you are working on.
See other source files in the same module to find out which namespace to use.


In header files, only include the header files of the superclass.
Other classes can be defined using

    class SomeOtherClass;

In the cxx file, you can include SomeOtherclass.h. This speeds up compilation.


When referring to a variable of an object, always use this->variable.
This increases readibility.

Exceptions: for VTK classes, use VTK coding standards.
